Demo 0: establish working denial of service attack
	1. run gnc -u -l 5000 on Router 4
	2. run gnc -u ROUTER4_IP 5000 on Router 6
	3. Send messages from Router 4 to 6
	4. Conduct the attack: ping dest_ip -i 0.000001 from machA to machB (router 4 & 6 on path)
		in our case: mach1 and mach10

Demo 1: demonstrate rdp prevails during DoS
	1. I think it's the same experiment as Demo 0 but the results should be different ofc
